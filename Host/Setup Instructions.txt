This guide assumes that the Raspberry Pi has Raspbian installed on it already.
The first step is to install the apache server. This is done by using the following command.
"sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5"
Then you need to allow for overrides by changing "AllowOverride None" to "AllowOverride ALL" in the file located at "sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default".
Restart the server. "sudo service apache2 restart"
The files for your site are located under "/var/www". We need to change the permissions so run the following commands.
"cd /var/
sudo chmod 777 /www"

This will allow use to update the web files using WinSCP if we want.

Then we want to install the mysql server. "sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client php5-mysql"
You will need to set a password for the MYSQL root user. Make sure to remember it.
In order to better monitor the DB we used PHPMyAdmin.
Run "sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin". Follow the intructions until it is done.
We will also need to setup Apache to include our PHPMyAdmin installation.
Enter "sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf"
Add "Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf" to the bottom.
Save and exit.
Restart Apache "sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart"

To find out where your website is use "ifconfig" and find the IP Address. That IP is what you will use to get to the site.
To get to the PHPMyAdmin go to "IP_ADDRESS/phpmyadmin"
